Agreement
When you download and use this mod, you agree to the fact that my mods all connect to a central server to count anonymously how many times you start a game with them. No personal information is transferred in any way, no connection information is stored (the cloud I use does not expose this to me). The purpose is solely for keeping track of how much my mods are used.
